# Diabete-prediction-deployement
This project implements a web application for predicting diabetes based on diagnostic measurements using a machine learning model. The application is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework, and incorporates a predictive model trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

# Key Features:
User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for entering diagnostic measurements.
Prediction: Predicts whether a patient has diabetes using a trained machine learning model.
Data Input: Accepts input for various health parameters including glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc.
Results Display: Displays the prediction result based on the input data.
# Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language used for backend logic and machine learning model.
Django: Web framework for building the application.
Machine Learning: Utilizes scikit-learn for building and deploying the predictive model.
HTML/CSS: Frontend design and styling.
GitHub: Version control and repository hosting.
# How to Use:
Clone the repository locally.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Django development server using python manage.py runserver.
Access the application through a web browser at http://localhost:8000/.
Enter the required diagnostic measurements and click 'Submit' to get the prediction result.
